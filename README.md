About:

Andrew Ng has earned the reputation as one a leading Machine Learning expert. This course is part of his Deep Learning courses. This course was very insightful that followed a well-structured blueprint. The coding portion was a bit too straight-forward for me. However, I felt that because I am keen on improving my Python expertise.

This is the second part of his Deep Learning Course. Excellent course!
